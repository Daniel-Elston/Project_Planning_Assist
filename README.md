## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to aid in project planning/tracking. The Gantt chart generator allows you to specify project stage, starting/ending dates, starting/ending hours, anticipated stage hours and actual completion stage hours. From this, you are able to see how long each stage could take (based off estimated hour input), how long each actually took to complete and how many hours over/under you are, allowing you to adjust timings accordingly for the next project (allow for more hours if a particular stage took longer than anticipated). 

### Project Description
Synthetic data (estimated hours based on previous experience) was created to allow an example Gantt chart to be created. A Gantt chart generator has been created which can now be attached on to each future project to plan projects, allocate time to each project stage and learn from past timing experiences.

### Objectives
- Develop tool to aid in Project Management
- Allow for visualisation of project stage timings
- Gain experience using plotly
- Gain insight into project stage timings


## Data Science Methodology
The below subsections outline the standard methodology of data scientists.

### Problem Formulation
Build a tool that will either allow you to track as you go, or plan project stage timings before beginning. The Gantt chart generator will show you how well you allocated time to each project stage.

### Modelling 
NA

### Deployment
Utilising synthetic data, the project works as intended.
This will be validated in future projects as an add on tool.

## Conclusions
A Gantt chart generator has been created allowing you to proactively allocate time to each project stage and assess how well you have estimated/managed your time.
What's more, you can simply use the generator as a project tracker, adding in each project stage as you go.
